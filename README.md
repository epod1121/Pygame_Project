A classic multi-level 2D platformer game developed in Python using the Pygame library. This project was built by a team of five software engineering students to demonstrate skills in object-oriented programming, game loop mechanics, physics implementation, and collaborative software development using Git.

‚ú® Key Features

Dynamic Player Physics: Implemented character movement including running, jumping, and gravity.

Collision Detection: Robust collision detection between the player, environment tiles, and enemies.

Multiple Levels: The game is designed with a scalable structure to allow for multiple, distinct levels.

User Interface: Features a complete UI, including a main menu to start the game, a scoring system, and a pause menu.
